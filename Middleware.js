In Redux, middleware is a powerful feature that sits between the dispatching of an action and the point it reaches the reducers. 
  It allows you to add custom logic, side effects, or transformations to the Redux data flow.
  Middlewares provide a way to intercept and modify actions before they reach the reducers.

Key characteristics of Redux middlewares:

Enhances dispatch: Middlewares can modify the behavior of the dispatch function, allowing you to intercept, transform, or delay actions.

Pluggable: Multiple middlewares can be used in a Redux application, and they can be composed together to form a chain of transformations.

Reusability: Middlewares can be designed as reusable modules, making it easier to apply them across different projects.



  To apply this middleware in a Redux store, you need to use the applyMiddleware function from the Redux library:

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';
import logger from 'redux -logger'


const loggerMiddleware = logger()

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(loggerMiddleware));
The applyMiddleware function takes one or more middlewares as arguments and returns a store enhancer.
  It is used when creating the Redux store, as shown in the example above.

Common use cases for middlewares in Redux:

Logging: Logging middleware, like the example above, can help with debugging by providing a log of dispatched actions and the resulting state.

Async operations: Middlewares such as Redux Thunk or Redux Saga enable handling of asynchronous operations, such as making API calls or delaying actions.

Authentication: Middleware can intercept actions related to authentication, check the users authentication status, and redirect or modify actions accordingly.

Routing: Middleware can intercept navigation actions and interact with a routing library to handle navigation within the application.

Error handling: Middlewares can catch errors thrown during action dispatching and perform error handling or logging.

By leveraging middlewares, you can extend Reduxs capabilities, introduce custom logic, and handle a wide range of scenarios in your applications data flow.
  Middlewares provide a flexible and reusable mechanism for enhancing Reduxs behavior and integrating with other libraries or systems.

Redux middleware is essentially a way to extend Redux with custom functionality. Middleware allows you to wrap the store's dispatch method. The key feature of middleware is that it is composable, meaning multiple middleware can be combined together, where each middleware requires no knowledge of what comes before or after it in the chain redux.js.org.

The most common use case for middleware is to support asynchronous actions without much boilerplate code or a dependency on a library like Rx. Middleware like redux-thunk allows action creators to dispatch functions, which can call dispatch asynchronously. Such functions are called thunks redux.js.org.

Let's see how we can apply middleware in Redux:

Import the necessary functions and middleware
First, we need to import the createStore and applyMiddleware functions from Redux. We will also import the middleware we want to use, in this case, redux-thunk.

import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import rootReducer from './reducers/index';

Create the store with middleware
Next, we create the Redux store and apply the middleware. The applyMiddleware function is used with the createStore function to apply the middleware to the store.

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));

Use middleware in action creators
With middleware like redux-thunk, we can now write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The middleware gives us access to the dispatch and getState functions.

function getUser() {
   return function(dispatch, getState) {
      // We can dispatch another action here
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_REQUEST' });

      // And make asynchronous calls
      return axios.get('/get_user_details')
        .then(response => {
          // We can dispatch another action with the response data
          dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', payload: response.data });
        });
   };
}

Conditional Middleware Application
Sometimes, you may want to conditionally apply a middleware. For instance, you may want to use certain middleware only in a development environment and not in production. This can be achieved as follows:

let middleware = [thunk];
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const logger = require('redux-logger').default;
  middleware = [...middleware, logger];
}
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(...middleware)
);
redux.js.org

This conditional application of middleware can help reduce the size of your builds and improve performance by ensuring that certain middleware (like logging middleware) are not included in the production environment.

Remember, middleware is not a fundamental part of the Redux architecture, but it is supported in the core because it is useful for extending dispatch in the ecosystem redux.js.org.
